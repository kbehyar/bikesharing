## Overview of the analysis

Before we present our Bike Sharing service investment opportunity in Des Moines to a group of investors we would like to analyze existing data from NewYork city's bike sharing service (Citibike). The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether our service will be profitable based on several measures. Some of these measures include: length of trips, positioning of bike stations across the city and maintenance costs for the bikes
