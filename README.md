## Overview of the analysis

Before we present our Bike Sharing service investment opportunity in Des Moines to a group of investors we would like to analyze existing data from NewYork city's bike sharing service (Citibike). The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether our service will be profitable based on several measures. Some of these measures include: length of trips, positioning of bike stations across the city and 


tenance costs for the bikes

This heatmap represents the hours of which day during a week and how active renters are. Between 6-9 AM & 5-6 PM is generally the time when most bikes get used throughout a week. Between 12 - 5 AM is a great time to do maintenance on the bikes since the activity is very low. This graph also shows that majority of users are commuters.

This is another illustration to show the bike usage during the month of August and it's peak hours which confirms 6-9 AM & 5-6 PM.

## Summary

Based on our analysis we can determine that Majority of our users are Male subscribers commuting between work and home during the hours of 6-9 AM & 5-6 PM. Most rides are used for short durations of less than 1 hour. We can also look at distance travelled to determine which stations bokes are rented from and dropped off at. By adjusting the prices of subscriptions we can attract more subscribers. During the mours of 12 - 5 AM is the perfect time to do maintenance on the Bikes.
